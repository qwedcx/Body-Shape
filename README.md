BodyShape - Adaptive Landing Page
This project is an adaptive landing page layout inspired by a YouTube course.
I initially coded about half the layout together with the instructor, then after a few days started over and completed the project independently.
The folders with images and assets were reused from the original project to avoid downloading them again.

Clean and semantic HTML and CSS

Fonts: Bebas Neue, Roboto

How to run
Clone the repository

Open index.html in any modern browser

Notes
This is a learning project and may contain unfinished parts

Image folders were taken from the original course project
